        These are the words spoken from Skull Knight to Guts. Guts is often
        referred to by Skull Knight as "Struggler" or "He Who Struggles" because
        of his nature to fight on no matter what. Herein lies one of the biggest
        themes that Berserk delves deep into.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Keep Struggling Forward</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        The term "Struggler" has taken on a meaning in the community surrounding
        Berserk. Those in the community use it to refer to one another because
        of the implications of the term and the way most of those who read
        Berserk relate to its usage. Life is really hard. Life can be seen as a
        neverending stream of pain and misery with which we are cursed to take
        part in, doomed to die, left to fend for ourselves in a cruel world
        without rhyme or reason. Those who identify themselves as strugglers
        relate our reality to the reality that Guts faces in the world of
        Berserk. The endless struggles and pain he faces, losing the woman he
        loves, losing the closest thing to a family he ever had, having both of
        them taken away by someone who he felt was a something akin to a
        brother. This doesn't even bring in all the pain he has endured. If you
        know, then you know. Guts has endured unspeakable pain, gone through the
        very depths of despair and hopelessness. Yet he continues to march
        forward. He struggles on. But Guts is by no means a clean-cut hero.
        <br />
        <br />
        Often throughout Berserk, people take Guts to task for his seemingly
        selfish actions. He abandons the woman he loves when she has lost
        herself in the name of revenge, he uses underhanded tactics in battle
        such as taking innocent children hostage, he destroys towns while
        fighting Demons because he just doesn't care about them, he lets
        innocents around him get injured, but that isn't even the worst of it.
        At a particular point in the story Guts begins to hallucinate a creature
        that represents his Hatred and Maliciousness, called the Beast Of
        Darkness. This Beast leads Guts to some of his darkest moments, moments
        where those around him say that He is even scarier than the monstrous
        Demons he is facing. It is at this point in the story where a key moment
        occurs, Guts must decide whether or not to struggle against himself,
        this Beast inside him that wants to destroy everything he loves so he
        can give himself completely over to hate and malice. Does he fight on,
        or does he give in? Does he take the road that is pulling him in
        everyday? Every battle? In the end, Guts chooses not to give in. Instead
        he pledges to struggle on and fight with everything he has to protect
        the woman he loves and to never abandon her again. It's moments like
        these, moments where Guts is full of regret and sadness but isn't of
        giving up he chooses to struggle forward that are the message of
        Berserk.

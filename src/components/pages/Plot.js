        Berserk follows the life of the main character, Guts, as he struggles
        through life. Throughout the various arcs of the story we see Guts
        undergo various changes including two complete character shifts with
        overarching character growth as he ages. We see him grow from a child to
        a man. Along the way he goes through various events that affect not only
        Guts himself but also the world around him, leading him to various
        moments of turmoil and despair. But the key theme of Berserk is to
        struggle forward when times are rough. When it seems like the world is
        ending, when all hope is lost, continue to struggle forward. Never give
        up.

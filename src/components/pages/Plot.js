        The Following is a brief synopsis of the basic plot of Berserk
      </h3>

      <p className="text">
        Berserk is the story of a man named Guts. We follow him throughout his
        life, watching as he grows and changes. From the moment he was born,
        Guts was dealt an awful hand in life. He faces insurmountable odds after
        insurmountable odds, he deals with unspeakable trauma and pain that will
        never truly heal or go away. He loses everyone and everything he loves
        multiple times, but he pushes forward through it all. He fights with
        everything he has, pushing and struggling forward even when all hope is
        lost.
        <br />
        <br />
        At first, Berserk seems to be the depressing story of a man losing
        everything so he can be angry all the time and kill mercilessly, but as
        you go through it evolves into something entirely different. Berserk is
        a story full of hope, love, and triumph. But that joy is only there if
        you are willing to go through unspeakable horrors, unbearable pain, and
        trauma that will scar you. You, the reader, go on a journey much like
        Guts where you are faced with unimaginable terror but despite that you
        are forced to carry on and push forward.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the end, Berserk is a story about facing the trauma you live with and
        finding a way to keep living. To keep struggling forward.
